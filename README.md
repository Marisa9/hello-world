Ideas, resources and discussions

Hello!

I am David, a business student interested in cryptoassets and more recently in programming and coding.
I am beginnning with Python as my first programming language and hope to acquire useful skills and knowledge to combine it with my interests.
Even if possible, one day be able to use what I learn to support the community.
